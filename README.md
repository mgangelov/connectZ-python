# connectZ-python
 
Python implementation of the ConnectZ problem. Tested with Python 3.7.3.

Included are some test cases checking whether the correct error conditions are set.

Pending more time, on first thought I would have probably done the following improvements:
* Better code and file structure - I would structure the code into separate files, based on function
* More comments - although I hope the code is to a good extend self explainable (due to appropriate variable naming), I could add more comments
* Bigger use cases should have been provided - perhaps a testing script that generates test cases would have been needed
